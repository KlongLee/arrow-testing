# Arrow IPC Test Files
These files contain Arrow streams. Some of them are linked to a specific issue
in [the Apache Issue Tracker](https://issues.apache.org/), so please see the
concrete issue for details. Files may contain data generated by fuzzers and may
therefore be hard to interpret by humans, but are great as a fuzzing test
corpus and to avoid regressions for fixed fuzzer crashes.

**Please notice that some files may provoke crashes so use them with care and in an isolated environment!**
