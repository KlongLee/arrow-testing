# Arrow IPC Test Files for Rust

This folder contains the files used for Arrow IPC support in Rust. They are generated with the `generate_rust_files.py` Python script.

The files contain all the Arrow types that are supported by the Rust implementation.
These files are broken into:

1. Primitives - boolean, numbers and temporal types
2. Lists - strings and lists of primitives
3. Structs - contains lists and primitives
